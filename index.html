                <p>I am a junior at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>. I develop high quality, efficient, bug-free software that meets demands of today's generation in tech. At the University of Washington, I am expanding my expertise in various computing fields such as data science, artificial intelligence, computer security, human-centered design, etc. My goal is to bring these fields together and create working technical solutions for everyday problems in the world. I want to make the world a better place, and I use software as my medium to do so.</p>
