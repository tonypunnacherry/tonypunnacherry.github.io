  <h4>My Journey</h4>
  <p>When I was little, I quickly got interested in computers. Before programming, my main form of creativity was in
    Office products such as Word and PowerPoint. I used Word to write stories and pushed PowerPoint to its limits. I
    used hyperlinks between slides and mouse events to create games and other creations with PowerPoint. Little did I
    know that these skills were also programming skills.</p>
  <p>In 3rd grade, my parents noticed what I was doing, and showed me HTML. I quickly got interested in it. At first, I
    had to copy code from online to create things, but eventually I got the hang of it and started programming on my
    own. I also learned JavaScript which introduced me to basic programming concepts like variables, functions, and
    control structures.</p>
  <p>With this background knowledge, I was quick to learn more programming languages and web development technologies. I
    started delving into tools like Vue.js to create single page applications, and also quickly adapted to
    object-oriented programming in Java.</p>
  <p>Today, I am primarily a web developer in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but frequently program in Java and Python. I use
    Java for my FIRST Robotics team in high school.</p>
    <p>And don't worry, I'm not a braindead programmer. I have other hobbies including exploring the outdoors, reading, playing videogames, and socializing with friends.</p>
